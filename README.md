Smart View

The pandemic has drastically disrupted consumer behavior, the e-commerce
industry has been booming and our project intends to capitalize
on it. The human cost and labor have caused endless issues for brick-and-
mortar stores, thereby making them obsolete by the day.


E-commerce is a growing industry and has proven itself to be a massive
advance in the way we as consumers purchase goods. The convenience
that online stores provide is simply unparalleled and the increased
scalability and marketing opportunities they provide proves that they are a
very important aspect that all current and future businesses need to invest
in. We chose this topic to provide consumers with a modern and
convenient place to purchase goods, and strives to compete with massive
e-commerce stores such as Amazon and ebay.

Our project the smart view proved an easy way to have a look at the prices
of various goods and technologies available over the internet.
We will be using different types of files and Database management
systems for this project.

Our objective is to raise the bar of the customer experience by using the
internet and technology.
